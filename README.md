You’re busy working on real projects. You’ve already context-switched all day. You can't be arsed to speak to a recruiter.

It’s a short, honest guide to what typically happens on a first-stage screening call, with a solid tech recruiter; why certain questions are asked, and how to make the conversation as efficient and painless as possible — for you.

## What Is a First-Stage Screening Call with a tech recruiter?

A screening call is usually a short (20 minute) conversation designed to check **basic alignment** before either side invests more time.

It is *not*:
- A technical interview  
- A deep assessment of your ability  
- A test of whether you “say the right things”

It *is*:
- A sense check on role fit
- A chance to remove obvious blockers early
- A two-way conversation to decide whether it’s worth progressing

## Common Screening Questions (and why they’re asked)

### Name
Not a trick, just confirming we’re speaking to the right person and how you prefer to be addressed.

---

### Current Location
Helps understand:
- Time zone alignment
- Office / hybrid expectations
- Right-to-work considerations (without going deep yet). If the business can't sponsor, 90% of the time the call will be cut short after 90 seconds. 
---

### Visa Status
This is asked early to avoid wasting your time later if sponsorship isn’t possible for the role. If the business can't sponsor, 90% of the time the call will be cut short after 90 seconds. 

You’re not expected to overshare — just enough to confirm feasibility and confirmation of 'we can sponsor'

---

### Permanent or Contract Preference
Clarifies whether the role type actually matches what you’re looking for.

This avoids frustration on both sides later in the process. 

---

### Salary Expectations 
This isn’t about lowballing - the recruiter will always try to get you the best offer. It's in their best interest. 

It’s about checking alignment early so neither side invests time in something that can’t realistically work.  
If you prefer ranges or market-aligned expectations, that’s completely fine, the recruiter will share this with you. 
We don't need to know what you earn; just "realistically" what you are looking to achieve (£)

---

### How Many Interviews Do You Currently Have On the Go?
This gives context around:
- Timeline urgency
- Competing offers
- How quickly feedback may need to move

You don’t need to give exact numbers — high-level context is enough.

---

### Current Notice Period
Helps hiring teams plan realistically and avoid surprises around start dates.

## The 10-Minute CV Run-Through

This part often makes people uneasy, but it’s not an interrogation.

The goal is to:
- Understand what you’re actually working on now
- Clarify anything that isn’t obvious from bullet points on your CV
- Hear how *you* describe your experience in your own words
- Hear how you communicate, generally

You don’t need to recite your CV.

A good approach would be:
- Focus on your most recent role
- Focus on the challenge
- Talk about what *you* owned or influenced
- Give context, not perfection

---

## What You’re Allowed to Do (and Say)

You’re allowed to:
- Ask what the role is really solving
- Say you’re not sure yet
- Decide the role isn’t for you
- End the process early if it doesn’t feel right
- But, if the recruiter has delivered a confident, well thought through pitch, you might as well put you're name in the hat and go for it. What's the worst that can happen right? 

A screening call is not a commitment — it’s just a conversation.

---

## Final Note

If a screening call feels rushed, unclear, or one-sided, that’s useful signal — not failure. Bin the recruiter off! 

Good hiring processes should feel transparent, human, and efficient.  
This guide exists to help move things closer to that standard.
